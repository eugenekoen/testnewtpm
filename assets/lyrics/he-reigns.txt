  VERSE 1
  -------      
  It's the song of the redeemed
  Rising from the African plain
  It's the song of the forgiven
  Drowning out the Amazon rain
  The song of Asian believers
  Filled with God's holy fire
  It's every tribe, every tongue, every nation
  A love song born of a grateful   choir
      
      
  CHORUS
  ------      
  It's all God's children singing
  Glory, glory, hallelujah
  He reigns, He reigns
  It's all God's children singing
  Glory, glory, hallelujah
  He reigns, He reigns
      
      
  VERSE 2
  -------      
  Let it rise above the four winds
  Caught up in the heavenly sound
  Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals
  To the faithful gathered underground
  Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation
  Some were meant to persist
  Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples
  None rings truer than this
      
  BRIDGE
  ------
  And all the powers of darkness
  Tremble at what they've just heard
  'Cause all the powers of darkness 
  Can't drown out a single word
      
      
  FINAL CHORUS
  ------------
  When all God's children sing out
  Glory, glory, hallelujah
  He reigns, He reigns (He reigns)
  All God's children sing out
 
  Glory, glory, hallelujah
  He reigns, He reigns (He reigns)
  All God's people singing
  Glory, glory, hallelujah (every tribe, every nation)  
  He reigns, He reigns (Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
