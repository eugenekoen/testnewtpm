    ----------
    SON OF GOD
    ----------

    Son of God, Lord of light
    Beautiful in angels sight
    Heaven's crown, Majesty
    Laid aside to rescue me
    
    Son of God, God with us
    Sharing in our flesh and blood
    Bled and died, on Calvary
    Took up our infirmity 
    

    Resurrected from the dead
    You're the lifter of my head

    Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty
    I am Yours, You are mine
    You have won my heart's adoration
    Lord of all time
    Ruler of the Nations
    Lover of my soul
    Glorified above all creation

    Jesus Immanuel
    Jesus Immanuel
