  I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
  ==================
   
  VERSE 1
  -------
  I can only imagine what it will be like
  When I walk, by your side
  I can only imagine what my eyes will see
  When your face is before me

  I can only imagine
   
  CHORUS 1
  --------
  Surrounded by You glory
  What will my heart feel
  Will I dance for you Jesus
  Or in awe of You be still

  Will I stand in your presence
  Or to my knees will I fall
  Will I sing hallelujah
  Will I be able to speak at all

  I can only imagine
  I can only imagine
   
  VERSE 2

  I can only imagine when that day comes
  When I find myself standing in the Son
  I can only imagine when all I would do is forever
  Forever worship You

  I can only imagine
  I can only imagine
