   THIS IS MY DESIRE

   VERSE
   -----
   This is my desire to honor You
   Lord with all my heart I worship You

   All I have within me, I give You praise
   All that I adore is in You
   
   CHORUS
   ------
   Lord I give You my heart,
   I give You my soul, I live for You alone

   Every breath that I take,
   Every moment I'm awake,
   Lord have Your way in me
