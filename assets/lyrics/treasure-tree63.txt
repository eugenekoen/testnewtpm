  TREASURE
  --------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Taken up out of the world
  Shaken up with just the Word
  Turned around so suddenly
  I'm alive eternally
  Something invisible, has become beautiful
  I know I'm born again,  laughin' and stumblin'
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Draw me close to You,  let me run to You
  Show me all Your kingdom come
  
  CHORUS 1
  --------
  My heart is where my treasure lies
  My great reward is in Your eyes
  My ev'ry breath belongs to You
  You are my treasure, yeah, yeah
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Take the world up out of me
  Put the fruit back on the tree
  I give every thing to be
  What only You want me to be
  The treasure that You've become
  Is shining brighter than the sun
  Feels like I'm born again,  but I'm stumblin'
