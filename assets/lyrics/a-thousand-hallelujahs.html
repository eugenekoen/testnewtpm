  ================================================ 
  A THOUSAND HALLELUJAHS
  ======================

  VERSE 1
  -------
  Who else would rocks cry out to worship
  Whose glory taught the stars to shine
  Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
  But this joy is mine
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify Your name
  You alone deserve the glory, 
  the honor and the praise
  Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
  A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
    
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Who else would die for our redemption
  Whose resurrection means I’ll rise
  There isn’t time enough to sing of 
  all You’ve done
  But I have eternity to try
   
  INSTRUMENTAL
  ------------
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Praise to the Lord
  To the Lamb
  To the King of heaven

  Praise for He rose
  Now He reigns
  We will sing for - ever
