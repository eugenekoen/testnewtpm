  VERSE 1

  How great how great is He
  Our one and only King

  How good how good is He
  Our Mighty Risen King

  How big how big is He
  We stand in awe of Him

  Always Just
  Always Strong
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  We want to praise Him praise Him
  Hallelujah

  Love Him Love Him
  Hosanna

  Lift our hands and Worship Him
  He is good and He is King
