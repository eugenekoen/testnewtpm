  VERSE 1
  -------
  Your mercy taught us how to dance
  to celebrate with all we have
  and we'll dance to thank you for mercy
  
  Verse 2:
  Your Glory taught us how to shout
  to lift Your name over all the earth
  and we'll shout to the praise of your glory 
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  It's the overflow
  of a forgiven soul
  and now that we've seen you God
  our hearts cannot stay silent
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  And we'll be a Dancing generation
  Dancing because of Your great mercy Lord
  Your great mercy Lord
  
  And we'll be a Shouting generation
  Shouting because of Your great Glory Lord
  Your great Glory Lord
