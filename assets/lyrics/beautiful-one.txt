   BEAUTIFUL ONE
   =============
   
   VERSE 1
   ------- 
   Wonderful, so wonderful, is Your unfailing love
   Your cross has spoken mercy over me
   No eye can see, no ear has heard, 
   no heart can fully know
   
   How glorious, how beautiful You are
   
   CHORUS
   ------
   Beautiful One I love, beautiful One I adore
   Beautiful One, my soul must sing
   
   VERSE 2
   -------
   Powerful, so powerful, Your glory fills
   the skies,
   Your mighty works displayed for all to see
   The beauty of Your majesty awakes my 
   heart to sing
   How marvelous, how wonderful You are
   
   BRIDGE
   ------
   And You've opened my eyes to Your wonders anew
   You captured my heart with this love
   Cause nothing on Earth is as beautiful as You
   
   ENDING
   ------
   My soul my soul must sing 
   my soul my soul must sing
   My soul my soul must sing, 
   Beautiful One
