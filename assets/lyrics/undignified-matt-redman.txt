  UNDIGNIFIED

  VERSE
  -----
  I will dance, I will sing
  To be mad   for my King.
  Nothing Lord, is hindering
  The passion in   my soul.
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  And I'll become even more undigni-fied than this.  
  (Some would say it's foolish-ness but)
  I'll become even more undigni-fied than this.
      
  Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey!
  Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey!
