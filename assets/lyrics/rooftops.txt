  VERSE 1
  -------
  Here I am before you
  Falling in love and seeking your truth
  Knowing that your perfect grace
  Has brought me to this place
  Because of you I freely live
  My life to you, oh God, I give

  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  So I stand before You God
  I lift my voice because you set me free
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  So I shout out your name from the rooftops I proclaim  
  That I am Yours, I am yours
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  All the good You've done for me
  I lift up my hand up hand for all to see
  You're the only one
  Who brings me to my knees
  To share this love across the earth
  The beauty of Your Holy Word
  
  BRIDGE

  Here I am, I stand with arms wide open
  To the one, the Son, the everlasting God (2x)
