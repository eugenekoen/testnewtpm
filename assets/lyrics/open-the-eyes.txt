  OPEN THE EYES OF MY HEART

  VERSE
  -----  
  Open the eyes of my heart, lord
  Open the eyes of my heart
  I want to see You, I want to see You  
      
  Open the eyes of my heart, lord
  Open the eyes of my heart
  I want to see You, I want to see You
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  To see You high and lifted up
  Shining in the light of your glory
  Pour out your power and love
  As we sing holy, holy, holy
        
  BRIDGE

  Holy, holy, holy
  Holy, holy, holy
  Holy, holy, holy
  I want to see You
