  ================================================
  SHOUT TO THE LORD
  =================
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Shout to the Lord all the earth let us sing
  Power and majesty praise to the king
  Mountains bow down and the seas will roar 
  at the sound of your name

  I sing for joy at the work of your hands
  Forever I'll love you forever I'll stand
  Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
   
  VERSE
  -----
  My Jesus, My Savior, Lord there is none like you
  All of my days, I want to praise, 
  the wonders of your mighty love
  My comfort, My shelter, 
  tower of refuge and strength
  Let every breath, all that I am, 
  never cease to worship you
