  GOD'S NOT DEAD
  --------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Let love explode and bring the dead to life
  A love so bold
  To see a revolution somehow.
  Let love explode and bring the dead to life
  A love so bold
  To bring a revolution somehow.
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Now I'm lost in your freedom
  And this world I'll overcome.
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  My God is not dead he's surely alive
  He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
  God is not dead he's surely alive
  He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
  He's Roaring, He's roaring, roaring like a lion
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Let hope arise and make the darkness hide
  My faith is dead
  I need a resurrection somehow
  
  BRIDGE (x3)
  ------
  Let Heaven roar and fire fall come shake the ground
  with the sound of revival
  
  LONG CHORUS
  -----------  
  My God is not dead he's surely alive
  He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
  God is not dead he's surely alive
  He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
  God is not dead he's surely alive
  He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
  God is not dead he's surely alive
  He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
  He's Roaring, He?s roaring, He's roaring like a lion
  He's Roaring, He?s roaring, He's roaring like a lion  
  Roaring like a lion.
