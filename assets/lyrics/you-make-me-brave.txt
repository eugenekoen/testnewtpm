  YOU MAKE ME BRAVE
  -----------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  I stand before You now, the greatness of Your renown
  I have heard of the majesty and wonder of You
  King of Heaven, in humility, I bow
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  As/Into Your love, in wave after wave
  Crashes over me, crashes over  me
  For You are for us, You are not against us
  Champion of Heaven, You made a way for all to enter (in)
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  I have heard You calling my name
  I have heard the song of love that You sing
  So I will let You draw me out beyond the shore
  Into Your grace,   Your grace
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  You make me brave, You make me brave
  You call me out beyond the shore into the waves
  You make me brave, You make me brave
  No fear can hinder now the love that made a way
                         (promises You've made)
  
  ENDING
  ------
  Champion of Heaven
  You made a way for all to enter in
