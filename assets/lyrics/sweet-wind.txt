  SWEET WIND

  INTRO
  -----
  There's a wind a-blowin',
  all across the land
  A fragrant breeze of Heaven
  Blowin' once again
  Don't know where it comes from
  Don't know where it goes
  But let it blow over me
  Oh,         sweet wind,
  come and blow over me
  
  There's a rain a-pourin',
  showers from above
  Mercy drops are comin'
  Mercy drops of love
  Turn your face to heaven
  Let the water pour
  Well let it pour over me
  Oh,          sweet rain,   
  Come and pour over me
  
  
  There's a fire a-burnin',
  falling from the sky
  Awesome tongues of fire
  Consuming you and I
  Can you feel it burnin'
  Burn the sacrifice
  Well let it burn over me
  Oh,          sweet fire,
  Come and burn over me
