=================================================
 I SPEAK JESUS
 =============
 
 VERSE 1
 -------
 I just want to speak the Name of Jesus
 Over every heart and every mind
 I know there is peace within Your presence
 I speak Jesus
  
 VERSE 2
 -------
 I just want to speak the Name of Jesus
 â€˜Til every dark addiction starts to break

 Declaring there is hope and there is freedom
 I speak Jesus
  
 CHORUS
 ------
 Your name is power
 Your name is healing
 Your name is life

 Break every stronghold
 Shine through the shadows
 Burn like a fire
  
 VERSE 3
 -------
 I just want to speak the Name of Jesus
 Over fear and all anxiety

 To every soul held captive by depression
 I speak Jesus
 
 BRIDGE
 ------
 Shout Jesus from the mountains
 And Jesus in the streets
 Jesus in the darkness over every enemy
 Jesus for my family
 I speak the holy name Jesus
 
 OUTRO
 -----
 I just want to speak the Name of Jesus
 Over every heart and every mind
 Cause I know there is peace within
 Your presence
 I speak Jesus
