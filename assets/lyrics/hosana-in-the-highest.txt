  HOSANNA
  -------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  I see the King of glory
  Coming on the clouds with fire
  The whole earth shakes
  The whole earth shakes

  I see His love and mercy
  Washing over all our sin
  The people Sing
  The people sing
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  Ho - sanna, Ho - san - na
  Hosanna in the Highest
  Ho - sanna, Ho - san - na
  Hosanna in the High - est
      
  VERSE 2
  -------
  I see a generation
  Rising up to take the place
  With selfless faith, with selfless faith
  I see a near revival
  Stirring as we pray and seek
  We're on our knees, we're on our knees
      
  INSTRUMENTAL

  BRIDGE
  ------
  Heal my heart and make it clean
  Open up my eyes to the things unseen
  Show me how to love like You have loved me 
  Break my heart for what breaks Yours
  Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
  As I walk from earth in - to eterni - ty
