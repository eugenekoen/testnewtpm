    BATTLE SONG
    -----------

    VERSE 1
    -------
    As the battle rages on
    Looking back at what You've done
    I can see Your hand in this
    Peace in every circumstance
    Tie Your truth around my waist
    Safe behind the shield of faith
    I will put Your armour on
    Lead me back to battle strong
    
    CHORUS
    ------
    In the chaos You reign
    In the tempest You save
    In the struggle You're strong
    Your praise on my tongue
    I will not be afraid
    For You call me by name
    To Your cause I belong
    You're my battle song
    
    VERSE 2
    -------
    I will put Your armour on
    I will sing a holy song
    I keep Your word in front me
    For You have won the victory
    
    BRIDGE
    ------
    Even on the frontline You are with me
    Even in the fire You're in control
    Even though a thousand may surround me
    I'm confident that You won't let me go
