  --------
  BE STILL
  --------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------  
  Be still and know
  That the Lord is in control
  Be still my soul
  Stand and watch as giants fall
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  I won't be afraid
  For You are here
  You silence all my fear
  I won't be afraid
  You don't let go
  Be still my heart and know
  I won't be afraid
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Be still and trust
  What the Lord has said is done
  Find rest don't strive
  Watch as faith and grace align  
  
  BRIDGE 1
  --------
  Surely love and mercy
  Your peace and kindness
  Will follow me
  Will follow me  
    
  BRIDGE 2
  --------
  Your love surrounds me
  Your love surrounds me here
  Your love surrounds me
  Your love surrounds me here
