  AT THE CROSS
  ------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  There’s a place, where mercy reigns and never dies
  There’s a place, where streams of grace flows deep and wide
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  All the love, I’ve ever found
  Comes like a flood, comes flowing down
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  At the cross, at the cross
  I surrender my life
  I’m in awe of you; I’m in awe of you
  Where your love ran red, and my sins washed white
  I owe all to you, I owe all to you
  Jesus
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  There’s a place, where sin and shame are powerless
  Where my heart has peace with God, and forgiveness
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Here my hope is found, here on holy ground
  Here I bow down, here I bow down
  Here arms open wide, here you saved my life
  Here I bow down, here I bow
