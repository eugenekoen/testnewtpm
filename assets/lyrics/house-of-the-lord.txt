  HOUSE OF THE LORD
  =================
   
  VERSE 1
  -------
  We worship the God who was
  We worship the God who is
  We worship the God who evermore will be
  He opened the prison doors
  He parted the raging sea
  My God, He holds the victory
   
  CHORUS 1
  --------
  There’s joy in the house of the Lord
  There’s joy in the house of the Lord today
  And we won’t be quiet, we shout out Your praise
  There’s joy in the house of the Lord.
  Our God is surely in this place.
  And wе won’t be quiet, we shout out Your praise
  (Oh-oh-oh) We shout out Your praise
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  We sing to the God who heals
  We sing to the God who saves
  We sing to the God who always makes a way
  'Cause He hung upon that Cross
  Then He rose up from that grave
  My God’s still rolling stones away
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
  We were the beggars, now we're royal--ty
  We were the prisoners, now we're running free
  We are forgiven, accepted, redeemed by His grace
  Let the house of the Lord sing praise
