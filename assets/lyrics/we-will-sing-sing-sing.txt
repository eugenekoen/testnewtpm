  WE WILL SING SING SING

  CHORUS
  ------
  We will sing, sing, sing
  And make music with the heavens
  We will sing, sing, sing
  Grateful that You hear us
  When we shout your praise
  Lift high the name of Jesus
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  What's not to love about You?
  Heaven and earth adore You
  Kings and kingdoms bow down
  Son of God, You are the One
  You are the One we're living for
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You are the love that frees us
  You are the light that leads us
  Like a fire burning
  Son of God, You are the One
  You are the one we're living for
