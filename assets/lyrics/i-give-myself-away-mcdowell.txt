  ------------------
  I GIVE MYSELF AWAY
  ------------------

  CHORUS
  ------
  I give myself away
  I give myself away so You can use me  
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Here I am, here I stand
  Lord, my life is in your hands
  Lord, I'm longing to see
  Your desires revealed in me
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Take my heart, take my life
  As a living sacrifice
  All my dreams, all my plans
  Lord, I place them in Your hands
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  My life is not my own
  To You I belong
  I give myself, I give myself to You.
