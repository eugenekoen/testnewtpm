    LIGHT OF THE WORLD
    ------------------
     
    VERSE 1
    -------
    Light of the world
    You stepped down into darkness
    Opened my eyes, let me see
    Beauty that made this heart adore You
    Hope of a life spent with You
     
    CHORUS
    -------
    Here I am to worship
    Here I am to bow down
    Here I am to say that You're my God
    You're altogether lovely
    Altogether worthy
    Altogether wonderful to me
     
    VERSE 2
    -------
    King of all days
    Oh so highlyexalted
    Glorious in Heaven above
    Humbly You came to the earth You created  
    All for loves sake became poor
     
    BRIDGE
    ------
    I'll never know how much it cost
    To see my sin upon that cross
     
    I'll never know how much it cost
