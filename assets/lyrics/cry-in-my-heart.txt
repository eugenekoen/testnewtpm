  CRY IN MY HEART
  ---------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  There's a cry in my heart  
  For your glory to fall   
  For your presence to fill up my senses   

  There's a yearning again
  A thirst for discipline   
  A hunger for things that are deeper

  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------  
  Could you take me beyond   
  Could you carry me through
  If I opened my heart 
  Could I go there with you

  For I've been here before
  Yet I know there's still more
  O Lord, I need to know you
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  For what do I have   
  If I don't have you Jesus     
  What in this life   
  Could mean anymore  
  You are my rock  
  You are my glory  
  You are the lifter of my head
