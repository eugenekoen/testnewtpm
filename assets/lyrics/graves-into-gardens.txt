  GRAVES INTO GARDENS

  FIRST VERSE
  -----------
  I searched the world
  But it couldn’t fill me
  Man’s empty praise
  and treasures that fade
  Are never enough

  SECOND VERSE
  ------------
  Then You came along
  And put me back together
  And every desire is now satisfied
  Here in Your love

  CHORUS
  ------
  Oh there’s nothing better than You
  There’s nothing better than You
  Lord there’s nothing, nothing is better
  than You

  INTERLUDE
  ---------

  THIRD VERSE
  I’m not afraid
  To show You my weakness
  My failures and flaws
  Lord You’ve seen them all
  And You still call me friend

  FOURTH VERSE
  ‘Cause the God of the mountain
  Is the God of the valley
  There’s not a place
  Your mercy and grace
  Won’t find me again

  CHORUS x2

  INTERLUDE x2

  BRIDGE 1
  --------
    You turn mourning to dancing
  You give beauty for ashes
  You turn shame into glory
  You’re the only one who can (repeat line)

  BRIDGE 2
  --------
  You turn graves into gardens
  You turn bones into armies
  You turn seas into highways
  You’re the only one who can
  You’re the only one who can

  CHORUS X2

  BRIDGE 2 X2

  TAG
  ---
  You’re the only one who can
