   YOU ARE GOOD
   ============

   VERSE 1
   -------
   Lord let Your glory fall,
   As on that ancient day
   Songs of enduring love,
   And then Your glory came

   And as a sign to You,
   That we would love the same,
   Our hearts will sing that song,
   God, let Your glory come
    
   CHORUS
   ------
   You are good, You are good,
   And Your love endures

   You are good, You are good,
   And Your love endures

   You are good, You are good,
   And Your love endures today
    
   VERSE 2
   -------
   Voices in unison,
   Giving You thanks and praise
   Joined by the instruments,
   And then Your glory came

   Your presence like a cloud,
   Upon that ancient day,
   The priests were overwhelmed,
   Because Your glory came
    
   VERSE 3
   -------
   A sacrifice was made,
   And then Your fire came,
   
   They knelt upon the ground,
   And with one voice they praised
