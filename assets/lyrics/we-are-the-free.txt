  ---------------
  WE ARE THE FREE
  ---------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------    
  We’re the forgiven
  Singing redemption’s song
  There’s a fire the burns inside
  A fire that burns inside
  Nothing can stop us
  We’ll be running through the night
  With a fire that burns inside
  A fire that burns inside
    
  CHORUS
  ------
  We are the free
  The freedom generation
  Singing of mercy
  You are the one who set us all in motion
  Yours is the glory
  There’s a fire in our hearts and it burns for You
  It’s never going to fade away
  We are the free and Yours is the Glory
      
  Oh Oh  Oh   Ooohh
      
  VERSE 2
  -------      
  We are the risen
  Living alive in you
  And our passion will not die
  No, our passion will not die
  Nothing can stop us
  We’ll be running through the night
  And our passion will not die
  No, our passion will not die
      
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Up from the grave You rose again
  Up from the grave You rose and we will rise up
  Rise up
  Into the world that You so love
  Into the world we go and we will rise up
  Rise up
  We will rise ----up
