  BE STILL

  VERSE 1
  -------  
  Be still and know
  That the Lord is in control
  Be still my soul
  Stand and watch as giants fall
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  I won't be afraid
  For You are here
  You silence all my fear
  I won't be afraid
  You don't let go
  Be still my heart and know
  I won't be afraid
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Be still and trust
  What the Lord has said is done
  Find rest don't strive
  Watch as faith and grace align

  Your love surrounds me
  Your love surrounds me here
  Your love surrounds me
  Your love surrounds me here
