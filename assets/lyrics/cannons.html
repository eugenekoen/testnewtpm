  CANNONS
  -------

  VERSE 1
  -------  
  It's falling from the clouds
  A strange and lovely sound
  I hear it in the thunder and the rain
  It's ringing in the skies
  Like cannons in the night
  The music of the universe plays
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  We're singing You are holy great and mighty
  The moon and the stars declare who you are
  I'm so unworthy but still you love me
  Forever my heart will sing of how great You are  
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Beautiful and free the song of galaxies
  Reaching far beyond the milky way
  Let's join in with the sound
  Come on let's sing it out as
  The music of the universe plays
  
  Singing...
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  All glory honor power is yours Amen
  All glory honor power is yours Amen
  All glory honor powers is your
  Forever Amen
