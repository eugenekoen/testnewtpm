  NOTHING WITHOUT YOU
  -------------------

  VERSE
  -----
  If it had not been for the Lord
  who was always on my side
  The enemy would have swallowed us
  Would have drowned in their waters
  
  But our souls have found an escape
  A hiding place in You
  The fowler's snare is broken
  Our help is in the name of the Lord
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  I'm nothing without You without You
  You are the air that I breathe
  Can't live without You without You
  In You I live and move and have my being
  
  Hosanna to Jehovah
  You are the air that I breathe
  Halellujah Halellujah
  In You I live and move and have my being
