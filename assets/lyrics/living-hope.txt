  LIVING HOPE

  VERSE 1
  -------
  How great the chasm
  That lay between us
  How high the mountain
  I could not climb
  In desperation
  I turned to heaven
  And spoke Your name
  Into the night
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Then through the darkness
  Your loving kindness
  Tore through the shadows
  Of my soul
  The work is finished
  The end is written
  Jesus Christ My living hope
  
  INSTRUMENTAL
  ------------
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  Who could imagine
  So great a mercy
  What heart could fathom
  Such boundless grace
  The God of ages
  Stepped down from glory
  To wear my sin
  And bear my shame
  
  VERSE 4
  -------
  The cross has spoken
  I am forgiven
  The king of kings
  Calls me his own
  Beautiful savior
  I’m yours forever
  Jesus Christ
  My living hope
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Hallelujah, Praise the one who set me free
  Hallelujah, Death has lost its grip on me
  You have broken every chain
  There’s salvation in your name
  Jesus Christ, My living hope
  
  VERSE 5
  -------
  Then came the morning
  That sealed the promise
  Your buried body
  Began to breath
  Out of the silence
  The roaring lion
  Declared the grave
  Has no claim on me        x2
  
  Jesus yours is the victory
