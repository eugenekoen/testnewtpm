  Raise a Hallelujah
  ------------------
  VERSE 1
  -------
  I raise a Hallelujah in the presence of my enemies
  I raise a Hallelujah louder than the unbelief
  I raise a Hallelujah, my weapon is a melody
  I raise a Hallelujah, heaven comes to fight for me
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm
  Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar  
  Up from the ashes, hope will arise
  Death is defeated, the King is alive
  
  VERSE 2 
  -------
  I raise a Hallelujah with everything inside of me
  I raise a Hallelujah I will watch the darkness flee
  I raise a Hallelujah in the middle of the mystery
  I raise a Hallelujah fear you lost your hold on me 
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Sing a little louder (Sing a little louder)
  Sing a little louder (Sing a little louder)
  Sing a little louder (Sing a little louder)
  Sing a little louder (Sing a little louder)
  
  Sing a little louder (in the presence of my enemies) 
  Sing a little louder (louder than the unbelief)
  Sing a little louder (my weapon is a meloody)
  Sing a little louder (heaven comes to fight for me)
  Sing a little louder
