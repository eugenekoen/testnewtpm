  VERSE
  -----
  Come Holy Spirit,   move among us
  Come Holy Spirit
  Flow living water,   flow within us
  Flow living water
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Your love is alive
  It's breaking the darkness
  It's bringing the light to soften the heart of stone 
  Your love is alive
  It's breaking the darkness
  It's winning the fight and bringing the orphan home
