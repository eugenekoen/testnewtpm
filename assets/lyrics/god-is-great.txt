  GOD IS GREAT

  VERSE 1
  -------
  All creation cries to you
  Worshipping in spirit and in truth 
  Glory to the faithful one
  Jesus Christ god’s son
   
  All creation gives you praise
  You alone are truly great 
  You alone are god who reigns 
  For eternity 
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  God is great and his praise
  Fills the earth fills the heavens 
  And your name will be praised 
  Through all the world
  God is great and his praise 
  Fills the earth fills the heavens 
  Cause we’re living for the glory of your name
  The glory of your name
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  All to you o god we bring
  Jesus teach us how to live
  Let your fire burn in us
  That all may hear that all may see

  Holy is the lord
  The whole earth sings
  The whole earth sings
