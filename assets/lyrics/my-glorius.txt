   MY GLORIOUS
   ===========
   VERSE 1
   -------
   The World is shaking with the love of God
   Great and glorious, let the whole earth sing

   And all you ever do is change the old for new
   People we believe that
   
   CHORUS
   ------
   God is bigger than the air I breathe
   The world we'll leave

   God will save the day and all will say
   My glorious!
   
   VERSE 2
   -------
   Clouds are breaking, heaven's come to earth
   Hearts awakening let the church bells ring

   And all you ever do is change the old for new
   People we believe that

   CHORUS 2
   --------
   God is bigger than the air I breathe
   The world we'll leave

   God will save the day and all will say

   My glorious!
   My glorious!
   My glorious!
