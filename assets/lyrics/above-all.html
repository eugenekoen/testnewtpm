  ================================================ 
   ABOVE ALL
   =========

   VERSE 1
   -------
   Above all powers, Above all Kings
   Above all nature, and all created things
   Above all wisdom, and all the ways of man 
   You were here before the world began
    
   VERSE 2
   -------
   Above all kingdoms, Above all thrones
   Above all wonders this world has ever known
   Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
   There's no way to measure what you're worth
    
   CHORUS
   ------
   Crucified, laid behind a stone
   You lived to die, rejected and alone
   Like a rose, trampled on the ground
   You took the fall, and thought of me 
   Above all
    
   CODA
   ----
   Like a rose, trampled on the ground
   You took the fall, and thought of me 
   Above all
