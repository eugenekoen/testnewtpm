  O PRAISE THE NAME
  -----------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  I cast my mind to Calvary
  Where Jesus bled and died for me
  I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
  My Saviour on that cursed tree
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  His body bound and drenched in tears
  They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
  The entrance sealed by heavy stone
  Messiah still and all alone
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  O praise the Name of the Lord our God
  O praise His Name forever - more
  For endless days we will sing Your praise
  Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  And then on the third at break of dawn
  The Son of heaven rose again
  O trampled death, where is your sting
  The angels roar for Christ the King
   
  VERSE 4
  -------
  He shall return in robes of white
  The blazing sun shall pierce the night
  And I will rise among the saints
  My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
   
  ENDING
  ------
  Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
  Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
