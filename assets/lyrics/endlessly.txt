  Savior of my soul
  Lover of my life
  I love you endlessly
  Passion of my heart
  Everything you are
  I love you endlessly
  
  PRE-CHORUS

  You loved me before I knew of You
  You loved me now I give it back to You
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  With Your Majesty here
  I fall to my knees
  I love You endlessly
  With the Beauty of Your Son
  I find myself undone
  I love You endlessly
