  BLESSED BE YOUR NAME
  --------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------  
  Blessed be Your name  in the land that is plentiful
  Where Your streams of abundance flow  blessed be Your name
  Blessed be Your name  when I'm found in the desert place
  Though I walk through the wilderness  blessed be Your name
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Every blessing You pour out I'll  turn back to praise 
  When the darkness closes in, Lord  still I will say
  
  CHORUS
  ------             
  Blessed be the name of the Lord
  Blessed be Your name
  Blessed be the name of the Lord
  Blessed be Your glorious name
  
  VERSE 2
  -------  
  Blessed be Your name  when the sun's shining down on me
  When the world's, "all as it should be"  blessed be Your name  
  Blessed be Your name  on the road marked with suffering 
  Though there's pain in the offering  blessed be Your name
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  You give and take away
  You give and take away
  My heart will choose to say
  Lord, blessed be Your name
