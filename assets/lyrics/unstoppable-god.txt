  UNSTOPPABLE GOD
  ---------------
  VERSE 1
  -------    
  Heaven thundered and the world was born
  Life begins and ends in the dust You formed
  Faith commanded and the mountains moved
  Fear is losing ground to our hope in You

  CHORUS
  ------           
  Unstoppable God
  Let Your glory go on and on
  Impossible things 
  In Your name they shall be done
      
  VERSE 2
  -------    
  Freedom conquered,  all our chains undone
  Sin defeated, Jesus has overcome
  Mercy triumphed  when the third day dawned
  Darkness was denied when the storm was gone      
               
  BRIDGE
  ------    
  Nothing shall be impossible
  Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
  We'll shout Your praise forevermore
  Jesus, our God unstoppable
