  GLORIUS DAY
  -----------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  I was buried beneath my shame
  Who could carry that kind of weight?
  It was my tomb 'Till I met You
  I was breathing but not alive
  All my failures I tried to hide
  It was my tomb 'Till I met You 
  You called my name and
  I ran out of that grave
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
  You called my name and I ran out of that grave  
  Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Now Your mercy has saved my soul
  Now Your freedom is all that I know
  The old made new, Jesus, when I met You
  You called my name and I ran out of that grave

  BRIDGE
  ------
  I needed rescue, my sin was heavy
  But chains break at the weight of Your glory
  I needed shelter, I was an orphan
  Now You call me a citizen of Heaven
  When I was broken, You were my healing
  Now Your love is the air that I'm breathing
  I have a future, my eyes are open
  'Cause when You called my name
  I ran out of that grave
