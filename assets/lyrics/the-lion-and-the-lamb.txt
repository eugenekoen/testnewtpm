  THE LION AND THE LAMB
  ---------------------
    
  VERSE 1
  -------
  He's coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms will bow down
  Every chain will break,  as broken hearts declare His praise  
  Who can stop the Lord Almighty
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Our God is a Lion, the Lion of Judah
  He's roaring in power, and fighting our battles
  And every knee will bow before Him
   
  Our God is a Lamb, the Lamb that was slain
  For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains
  And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
  Every knee will bow before Him
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Open up the gate, make way before the King of Kings
  The God who comes to save, is here to set the captives free
  For who can stop the Lord Almighty
