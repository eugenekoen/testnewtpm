  REVELATION SONG
  ---------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Worthy is the,
  Lamb who was slain
  Holy, Holy, is He
  Sing a new song, to Him who sits on
  Heaven's Mercy Seat
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Holy, Holy, Holy
  Is the Lord God Almighty
  Who was, and is, and is to come
  With all creation I sing:
  Praise to the King of Kings!
  You are my everything and I will adore You  
  Yeah!
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Clothed in rainbows, of living color
  Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
  Blessing and honor, strength and
  Glory and power be
  To You the Only Wise King,
  Yeah
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  Filled with wonder,
  Awestruck wonder
  At the mention of Your Name
  Jesus, Your Name is Power
  Breath, and Living Water
  Such a marvelous mystery
  Yeah...
