  VERSE 1
  -------
  You call me out upon the waters
  The great unknown where feet may fail
  And there I find you in the mystery
  In oceans deep, my faith will stand 
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  And I will call upon Your name
  And keep my eyes above the waves
  When oceans rise my soul will rest in Your embrace
  For I am Yours and You are mine
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Your grace abounds in deepest waters
  Your sovereign hand will be my guide
  Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
  You’ve never failed and You won’t start now 
   
  BRIDGE

  Let me walk upon the water wherever You would call me
  Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
  And my faith will be made stronger in the presence
  of my Savior
