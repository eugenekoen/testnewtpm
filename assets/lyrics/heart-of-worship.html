  ================================================ 
  HEART OF WORSHIP
  ----------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  When the music fades all is stripped away 
  and I simply come
  Longing just to bring something that's of worth 
  that will bless your heart
 
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  I'll bring you more than a song for 
  a song in itself is not what you have required
  You search much deeper within
  through the way things appear
  you're looking into my heart
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
  and it's all about you, 
  it's all about you Jesus
  I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it
  when it's all about you,
  it's all about you Jesus
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  King of endless worth no one could express
  how much you deserve
  Though I'm weak and poor all I have is yours,
  every single breath
