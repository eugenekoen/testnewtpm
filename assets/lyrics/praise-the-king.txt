  VERSE 1
  -------
  There’s a reason why the curse of sin is broken
  There’s a reason why the darkness runs from light
  There’s a reason why we stand here now forgiven
  Jesus is alive
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  There’s a reason why we are not overtaken
  There’s a reason why we sing on through the night
  There’s a reason why our hope remains eternal
  Jesus is alive
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  Praise the King, He is risen
  Praise the King, He’s alive
  Praise the King, deaths defeated
  Hallelujah He’s alive
  Hallelujah He’s alive
   
  VERSE 3
  -------
  There’s a reason why our hearts can be courageous
  There’s a reason why the dead are made alive
  There’s a reason why we share His resurrection
  Jesus is alive (Oh He’s alive)
   
  BRIDGE
  ------   
  The grave could not ignore it
  When all of heaven’s roaring
  Hell where is your victory
  Death where is your sting
  The world could not ignore it
  When all the saints are roaring
  Hell where is your victory
  Death where is your sting
