  ================================================ 
  SO WILL I (100 BILLION X)
  =========================

  VERSE 1
  -------
  God of creation, there at the start, 
  before the beginning of time
  With no point of reference
  You spoke to the dark, 
  and fleshed out the wonder of light
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  And as You speak, 
  a hundred billion galaxies are born
  In the vapor of Your breath the planets form
  If the stars were made to worship, so will I
  I can see Your heart in everything You've made
  Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
  If creation sings Your praises, 
  so will I
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  God of Your promise, You don't speak in vain, 
  no syllable empty or void
  For once You have spoken
  All nature and science follow the 
  sound of Your voice
   
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  And as You speak, 
  a hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
  Evolving in pursuit of what You said
  If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
  I can see Your heart in everything You say
  Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
  If creation still obeys You, so will I
   
  PRE-BRIDGE
  ----------
  So will I,  so will I
         
  BRIDGE
  ------
  If the stars were made to worship, 
  so will I
  If the mountains bow in reverence, 
  so will I
  If the oceans roar Your greatness, 
  so will I
  For if everything exists to lift You high, 
  so will I
  If the wind goes where You send it, 
  so will I
  If the rocks cry out in silence, 
  so will I
  If the sum of all our praises 
  still falls shy
  Then we'll sing again 
  a hundred billion times
  |__(a very long whoa)_____|          
          Whoa
   
  VERSE 3
  -------
  God of salvation
  You chased down my heart 
  through all of my failure and pride
  On a hill You created
  The light of the world 
  abandoned in darkness to die
   
  CHORUS 3
  --------
  And as You speak, 
  a hundred billion failures disappear                          
  Where You lost Your life
  so I could find it here
  If You left the grave behind You,
  so will I

  I can see Your heart in 
  everything You've done
  Every part designed in a 
  work of art called love
  If You gladly chose surrender, so will I

  I can see Your heart, 
  eight billion different ways
  Every precious one, a child You died to save
  If You gave Your life to love them, so will I
   
  (Acoustic Only) - Basically - Vocals only ;)
  Like You would again a hundred billion times
  But what measure could amount to Your desire
  You're the One who never leaves the one behind
