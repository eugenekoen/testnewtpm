  OH COME TO THE ALTAR
  --------------------
      
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Are you hurting and broken within?
  Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
  Jesus is calling.
  Have you come to the end of yourself?
  do you thirst for a drink from the well?
  Jesus is calling.
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  O come to,
  the altar,
  the Father's arms are open wide,
  forgiveness,
  was bought with,
  the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
      
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Leave behind your regrets and mistakes,
  come today thereâ€™s no reason to wait,
  Jesus is calling.
  Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy,
  from the ashes a new life is born,
  Jesus is calling.
      
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Oh what a Saviour,
  isn't He wonderful,
  sing hallelujah Christ is risen,
  bow down before Him,
  for He is Lord of all,
  sing hallelujah Christ is risen.
      
  OUTRO
  -----
  Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
  Tell the world of the treasure you found
