  It's open Heavens You're releasing

  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells
  We're stirring up deep deep waters
  We're going to dance in the river, dance in the river
  Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells
  We're stirring up deep deep waters
  We're going to jump in the river
  Jump in the river
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Deep cries out to deep cries out to
  Deep cries out to deep cries out to
  So we cry out to, we cry out to, You Jesus
  We're falling into deeper waters, calling out to You
  We're walking into deeper waters, going after You
