   HERE FOR YOU
   ============
 
   VERSE 1
   -------   
   Let our praise be Your welcome 
   Let our songs be a sign
   We are here for You, we are here for You

   Let Your breath come from heaven 
   Fill our hearts with Your life
   We are here for You, we are here for You
    
   CHORUS
   ------
   To You our hearts are open
   Nothing here is hidden
   You are our one desire

   You alone are holy
   Only You are worthy
   God, let Your fire fall down
    
   VERSE 2
   -------
   Let our shout be Your anthem
   Your renown fill the skies
   We are here for You, we are here for You

   Let Your Word move in power
   Let what's dead come to life
   We are here for You, we are here for You
    
   BRIDGE
   ------
   We welcome You with praise
   We welcome You with praise
   Almighty God of love,
   Be welcomed in this place

   We welcome You with praise
   We welcome You with praise
   Almighty God of love,
   Be welcomed in this place
    
   Let every heart adore
   Let every soul awake
   Almighty God of love
   Be welcomed in this place

   We welcome You with praise
   We welcome You with praise
   Almighty God of love,
   Be welcomed in this place
