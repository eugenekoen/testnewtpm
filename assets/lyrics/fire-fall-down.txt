  CHORUS
  ------
  'Cause I know that You're alive You came to fix 
  my broken life
  And I sing to glorify Your holy name 
  Jesus Christ
  
  INTERLUDE
  ---------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  You bought my life with the blood that You 
  shed on the cross
  When You died for the sins of men
  And You let out a cry crucified 
  Now alive in me
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  These hands are Yours teach them to 
  serve as You please 
  And I'll reach out desperate to see 
  all the greatness of God
  May my soul rest assured in You
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  I'll never be the same  
  No I'll never be the same
  
  
  INTERLUDE 2
  -----------
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  You've changed it all You broke down the 
  wall when I spoke
  And confessed In You I'm blessed
  Now I walk in the light, 
  In victorious sight of You
