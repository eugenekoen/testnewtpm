  ================================================ 
  ---------------
  I BELONG TO YOU
  ---------------
 
  VERSE 1
  -------
  You can be the One that steals my heart 
  With just a simple thought of who You are
  Let Your light shine in the darkest parts
  Let Your love fill the world
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You can be the fire down in my soul
  That I can't contain, that I can't control
  Would You fill me up to overflow
  Let Your love fill the world
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  And I belong to You
  Forever, I belong to You
   
  VERSE 3
  -------
  Let Your Words be like a burning flame
  Come in close to touch my heart again
  The whole earth trembles 
  at the sound of Your name
  Let Your love fill the world
   
  VERSE 4
  -------
  All I want is more of You
  Your breath is life, Your word is truth
  Your glory here is bursting through
  Let Your love fill the world
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
  And You have set my heart on fire
  My love and my desire
  Only for You
   
  And as Your glory fills this place
  Your love we will embrace
  Only for You, for You
