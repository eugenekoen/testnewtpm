  DRAW ME CLOSE
  -------------

  VERSE
  -----
  Draw me close to you
  Never let me go
  I lay it all down again
  To hear you say that I'm your friend
  You are my desire
  No one else will do
  Cause nothing else could take your place
  To feel the warmth of your embrace
  Help me find the way,     bring me back to you
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  You're all I want
  You're all I've ever needed
  You're all I want
  Help me know you are near
