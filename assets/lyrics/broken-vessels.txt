  Broken Vessels - Amazing Grace
  ------------------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  All these pieces
  Broken and scattered
  In mercy gathered
  Mended and whole
  Empty handed
  But not forsaken
  I've been set free
  I've been set free
  
  CHORUS 1
  --------
  Amazing grace
  How sweet the sound
  That saved a wretch like me
  Ooh I once was lost
  But now I'm found
  Was blind but now I see
  
  Oh I can see You now
  Oh I can see the love in Your eyes 
  Laying Yourself down
  Raising up the broken to life
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You take our failure
  You take our weakness
  You set Your treasure
  In jars of clay
  So take this heart Lord
  I'll be your vessel
  The world to see
  Your life in me
