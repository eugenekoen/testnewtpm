  VERSE
  -----
  All who are thirsty, all who are weak, come to the fountain
  dip your heart in the stream of life
  let the pain and the sorrows, be washed away,
  in the waves of his mercy
  as deep cries out too deep (we sing)
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  come Lord Jesus come
  come Lord Jesus come
  come Lord Jesus come
  come Lord Jesus come
  
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  Holy Spirit come
  Holy Spirit come
  Holy Spirit come
