  FOREVER
  -------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  The moon and stars they wept
  The morning sun was dead
  The Savior of the world was fallen
  His body on the cross
  His blood poured out for us
  The weight of every curse was broken
  
  INTERLUDE
  ---------
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  One final breathe He gave
  As heaven looked away
  The Son of God was laid in darkness
  A battle in the grave
  The war on death was waged
  The power of hell forever broken
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  The ground began to shake
  The stone was rolled away
  His perfect love could not be overcome
  Now death where is your sting?
  Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Forever He is glorified
  Forever He is lifted high
  Forever He is risen
  He is alive, He is alive

  We sing Hallelujah
  We sing Hallelujah
  We sing Hallelujah
  The Lamb has overcome
  
  END
  ---
  And now death where is your sting
  Our resurrected King has over-come
  He's overcome oh
