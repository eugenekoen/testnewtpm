  WAITING HERE FOR YOU
  --------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  If faith can move the mountains, 
  let the mountains move,  
  We come with expectation, 
  waiting here for you
  Waiting here for you
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You're the lord of all creation, 
  yet still you know my heart  
  The author of salvation, 
  you've loved us from the start,
  
  CHORUS
  ------  
  Waiting here for you, 
  with our hands lifted hi - gh in praise
  And it's you, we adore, 
  singing Al - le - lu - ia
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You are everything Youâ€™ve promised
  Your faithfulness is true
  And we're desperate for Your presence
  All we need is You
