  SEE HIS LOVE
  ------------
  
  VERSE
  -----
  See His love nailed onto a cross
  Perfect and blameless life given as sacrifice
  See Him there all in the name of love
  Broken yet glorious, all for the sake of us
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  This is Jesus in His glory
  King of Heaven dying for me
  It is finished, He has done it
  Death is beaten, Heaven bekons me
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Greater love no one could ever show
  Mercy so undeserved, freedom I should not know
  All my sin, all of my hidden shame
  Died with Him on the cross, eternity won for us  
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Such love, such love
  Such love is this for me
