  MAJESTY - HERE I AM
  -------------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Here I am, 
  Humbled by your majesty 
  Covered by your grace so free
  Here I am, 
  Knowing I'm a sinful man
  Covered by the blood of the Lamb

  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine 
  since you laid down your life
  The greatest sacrifice
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Majesty, Majesty - Your grace has found me just as I am
  Empty handed, but alive in your hands
  Majesty, Majesty - Forever I am changed by your love
  In the presence of your Majesty
  
  INSTRUMENTAL

  VERSE 2
  -------
  Here I am, 
  Humbled by the love that you give, 
  Forgiven so that I can forgive
  Here I stand, 
  Knowing that I'm your desire, 
  Sanctified by glory and fire
  Now I've found
  The greatest love of all is mine
  Since you laid down your life
  The greatest sacrifice
