  CHAMPION
  ========

  VERSE 1
  ------- 
  I've tried so hard to see it   
  Took me so long to believe it
  That you choose someone like me
  To carry your victory

  Perfection could never earn it
  You give what we don't deserve it
  And you take the broken things
  And raise them to glory
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  You are my Champion 
  Giants fall when you stand
  Undefeated
  Every battle you've won

  I am who you say I am
  You crown me with confidence
  I am seated in the heavenly place
  Undefeated
  With the one who has conquered it all
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Now I can finally see it
  You're teaching me how to receive it
  So let all the striving cease
  This is my victory
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  When I lift my voice and shout
  Every wall comes crashing down
  I have the authority
  Jesus has given me

  When I open up my mouth
  Miracles start breaking out
  I have the authority
  Jesus has given me
