  Come, now is the time to worship
  Come, now is the time to give your heart
  Come, just as you are to worship
  Come, just as you are before your God
  Come
  
  One day ev'ry tongue will confess you are God
  One day ev'ry knee will bow
  Still the greatest treasure remains
  For those who gladly choose you now
