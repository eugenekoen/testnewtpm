  ONE NAME

  VERSE 1
  -------
  Open our eyes to see
  The glory of your never-ending majesty
  We join our song in praise as all the angels sing
  Jesus seated high above it all
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  And all our other loves
  Pale before the risen Sun of Righteousness
  We’re standing in the presence of Your holiness
  Jesus seated high above it all
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  There is just one name
  Over every o – ther name
  You receive eternal praise, Jesus
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  There is only one name glori – fied
  There is only Jesus lifted high, o-o-oh
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  And every knee will bow
  In the skies above and on the earth below
  When every voice proclaims what we already know
  Jesus seated high above it all
  
  INSTRUMENTAL

  BRIDGE
  ------
  There's no one like our God
  There's no one like our King
  Praise His name
  
  Above everything
  Above everything
