 VERSE 1
 -------
 C/E               F                  C
  Who else would rocks cry out to worship
 C/E            F                     C
  Whose glory taught the stars to shine
 F          G               Am     
  Perhaps creation longs to have the 
 G        F
 words to sing
 F           G     C
  But this joy is mine
  
 CHORUS
 ------
 F                  C         
  With a thousand hallelujahs 
 G        Am      G
 we magnify Your name
 F              C               
  You alone deserve the glory, 
 G          Am      G
 the honor and the praise
 F           G                 C  Em  Am  G
  Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
   F             C/E          G        C
 A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more

 C/E               F              C
  Who else would die for our redemption
 C/E            F                 C
  Whose resurrection means I’ll rise
 F              G              
  There isn’t time enough to 
 Am       G          F
 sing of all You’ve done
 F              G         C
  But I have eternity to try
