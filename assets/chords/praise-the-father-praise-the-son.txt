  O sovereign God, O matchless King
             Em           D     G
  The saints adore, the angels sing
            C         Em             G
  And fall before the throne of grace
          C            D        G
  To You belongs the highest praise

  These sufferings, this passing tide
  Under Your wings I will abide
  And every enemy shall flee
  You are my hope and victory

  Praise the Father, Praise the Son

  The name above all other names

  To the valley, for my soul
  Thy great descent has made me whole
  Your word my heart has welcomed home
  Now peace like water ever flows

  Yours is the glory
  C    G     D   Em
  Forever..........
