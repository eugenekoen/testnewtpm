  THE RIVER IS HERE
  -----------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  C        G            D     G
  Down the mountain the river flows
          C        G            D       G
  And it brings refreshing wherever it goes
  C           G           D        G
  Through the valleys and over the fields
      C        G               D        G
  The river is rushing and the river is here
  
  CHORUS
  ------
      G                     C      G
  The river of God sets our feet a-dancing
      G                      D           G
  The river of God fills our hearts with cheer
      G                      C           G
  The river of God fills our mouths with laughter
      C    G             D        G
  And we rejoice for the river is here
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
      C        G      D            G
  The river of God is teeming with life
      C       G            D    G
  And all who touch it can be revived
      C         G         D            G
  And those who linger on this river's shore
          C         G             D           G
  Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
      C      G           D       G
  Up to the mountain we love to go
      C        G        D      G
  To find the presence of the Lord
      C        G            D        G
  Along the banks of the river we run
      C          G               D             G
  We dance with laughter giving praise to the Son
