  VERSE 1
  -------  
  E                     B
  It's falling from the clouds
  F#m                   C#m
  A strange and lovely sound
  A                  E              B
  I hear it in the thunder and the rain
  E                   B
  It's ringing in the skies
  F#m                  C#m
  Like cannons in the night
          A             E      B
  The music of the universe plays
  
  CHORUS
  ------
                  E            A
  We're singing You are holy great and mighty
          C#m                  B
  The moon and the stars declare who you are
  E               A
  I'm so unworthy but still you love me
  C#m               B
  Forever my heart will sing of how great You are

  Reaching far beyond the milky way
  A
  Let's join in with the sound
  E                     B

          A             E        B
  The music of the universe plays
  
  Singing...
