  From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
  F#m              F#m7/E           D
  Creation's revealing Your majesty

  C#m                                B               E
  Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
  F#m                    F#m7/E                 D
  Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
  C#m                              B            E
  Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
  F#m                        F#m7/E                 D
  Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night

  None can fathom
