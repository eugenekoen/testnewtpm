  God of creation, there at the start, 
  D                       C        Em  D
  before the beginning of time
       C
  With no point of reference
       Em                      
  You spoke to the dark,

  and fleshed out the wonder of light

  a hundred billion galaxies are born
                        G/B             C
  In the vapor of Your breath the planets form
           Em                C               G
  If the stars were made to worship, so will I
                           Em                D
  I can see Your heart in everything You've made
                          G/B         C
  Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
        Em                 C              
  If creation sings Your praises, 
          G     Em   D   G/B
  so will I

     D                C      Em   D
  no syllable empty or void
       C
  For once You have spoken
       Em                D

  sound of Your voice

  a hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
                  G/B             C
  Evolving in pursuit of what You said
         Em               C              G
  If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
                          Em               D
  I can see Your heart in everything You say
                       G/B           C

           C                                
  If the stars were made to worship, 
          Em    D
  so will I
           C                             
  If the mountains bow in reverence, 
          Em    D
  so will I
           C                       
  If the oceans roar Your greatness, 
         Em    D
  so will I
         C                             Em 
  For if everything exists to lift You high, 
          D
  so will I
          C                               
  If the wind goes where You send it, 
          Em    D
  so will I
          C                          
  If the rocks cry out in silence, 
          Em    D
  so will I
          C                           
  If the sum of all our praises 
              Em    D
  still falls shy
              C                       
  Then we'll sing again 
                    Em   D
  a hundred billion times
  C    Em  D  C    Em  D

  C
  God of salvation
        Em                         
  You chased down my heart 
          D                      C    Em  D
  through all of my failure and pride
        C
  On a hill You created
       Em                  
  The light of the world

  abandoned in darkness to die

  a hundred billion failures disappear
                             
  Where You lost Your life
    G/B           C
  so I could find it here
          Em               C            
  If You left the grave behind You, 
          G
  so will I
                          
  I can see Your heart in 
  Em                  D
  everything You've done
                            
  Every part designed in a 
  G/B               C
  work of art called love
           Em             C              G
  If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
                               
  I can see Your heart, 
        Em                   D
  eight billion different ways
                          G/B             C
  Every precious one, a child You died to save
          Em                C                 G
  If You gave Your life to love them, so will I
   
  (Acoustic Only)
                        Em               D
  Like You would again a hundred billion times
                          G/B            C
  But what measure could amount to Your desire
              Em             C               G
  You're the One who never leaves the one behind
