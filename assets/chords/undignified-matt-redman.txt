  VERSE
  -----
  D             G
  I will dance, I will sing
          D/F#  A/E      A
  To be mad   for my King.
  D                 G
  Nothing Lord, is hindering
              D/F#     A/E  A
  The passion in   my soul.
      
  CHORUS
  ------
      D       G        D/F#   A/E    A         D    G
  And I'll become even more undigni-fied than this.  
              D/F#     A/E      A
  (Some would say it's foolish-ness but)
  D       G        D/F#   A/E    A         D    G    D/F#  A/E  A  
  I'll become even more undigni-fied than this.
      
  D                   G       D/F#  A/E  A
  Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey!
  D                   G       D/F#  A/E  A   D
  Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey!
