  VERSE 1

  F                   C/E
  The moon and stars they wept
                  Dm
  The morning sun was dead
                  Bbmaj7             F
  The Savior of the world was fallen
              C/E
  His body on the cross
                      Dm
  His blood poured out for us
                  Bbmaj7
  The weight of every curse was broken

  One final breathe He gave
                  Dm
  As heaven looked away
                  Bbmaj7           F
  The Son of God was laid in darkness
                  C/E
  A battle in the grave
                      Dm
  The war on death was waged
                  Bbmaj7        F
  The power of hell forever broken

  The ground began to shake
                      Dm
  The stone was rolled away
                      Bb            F/A
  His perfect love could not be overcome
                      C
  Now death where is your sting?
              Dm                      Bb
  Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

  Forever He is risen
      Dm             Bb
  He is alive, He is alive
