  Em      C         G       Em    C        G
  Oh the joy I've found, Surrendering my crowns
          Am   G      D            Am        G   D
  At the feet of the King, Who surrendered everything
  Em       C          G              Em     C    G
  Oh the peace that comes, When I'm broken and undone  
           Am  G      D          Am      G        D
  By Your unfailing grace I can lift my voice and say

  CHORUS

  G              C/G   G
  You can have it all, Lord
                      Em
  Every part of my world
                      C     Em
  Take this life and breathe on
          Am                 G
  This heart that is now Yours
   
  BRIDGE
  C
  There is no greater call
  Em
  Than giving You my all
  G                  D
  I lay it all down, I lay it all down
      C
  There is no greater love
  Em
  No higher name above
  G                  D
  I lay it all down, I lay it all down
