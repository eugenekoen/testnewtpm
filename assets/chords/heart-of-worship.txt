  HEART OF WORSHIP

  VERSE 1

 D                A                        Em7                  
  When the music fades all is stripped away 
  Asus    A
  and I simply come
 D                     A                         Em7
  Longing just to bring something that's of worth 
            Asus       A
  that will bless your heart
 
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Em             D/F#        A        
  I'll bring you more than a song for 
    Em                    D/F#          A
  a song in itself is not what you have required
  Em              D/F#                   A                 Em
  You search much deeper within through the way things appear
                 D/F#       A
  you're looking into my heart
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  D                      A                         Em         D/F#      G
  I'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you, it's all
            A   D
  about you Jesus
  D                      A                         Em         D/F#      G
  I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when it's all about you, it's all
            A   D
  about you Jesus

    King of endless worth no one could express how much you deserve
  D                     A                      Em7                      Asus A
    Though I'm weak and poor all I have is yours, every single breath
