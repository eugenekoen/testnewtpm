  VERSE 1
  -------
  C                       Bb
    Taken up out of the world
                              Am7
  Shaken up with just the Word
                          F  
  Turned around so suddenly
                      C
  I'm alive eternally
                      Bb                   Am7
  Something invisible, has become beautiful
                      F                     G
  I know I'm born again,  laughin' and stumblin'
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
                  F                G
  Draw me close to You,  let me run to You
                      F
  Show me all Your kingdom come
  
  CHORUS 1
  --------
  C            Bb                  F/A
      My heart is where my treasure lies
              F                  C
  My great reward is in Your eyes
              Bb               F/A
  My ev'ry breath belongs to You
              F                   C C5 
  You are my treasure, yeah, yeah
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  C                          Bb
    Take the world up out of me
                                  Am7
  Put the fruit back on the tree
                          F  
  I give every thing to be
                              C
  What only You want me to be
                                  Bb
  The treasure that You've become
                                  Am7
  Is shining brighter than the sun
                          F                G
  Feels like I'm born again,  but I'm stumblin'
