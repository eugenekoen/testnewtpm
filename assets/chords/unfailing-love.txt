            G  
  When the darkness fills my senses,  
                                          C  
  When my blindness keeps me from Your touch,
          G      
  Jesus come.  

          G  
  When my burden keeps me doubting,  
                                  C  
  When my memories take the place of You,  
          G      
  Jesus come.

                  Em7          C  
  And I'll follow You there  
          Em7           C  
  To the place where we meet,  
                  Em7            C  
  And I'll lay down my pride  
          Em7         C  
  As You search me again.

  Your unfailing love over me again.
