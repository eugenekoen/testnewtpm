  VERSE 1
  -------      
  B
  There were walls between us
  By the Cross You came and 
  Emaj7
  broke them down, You broke them down
  B
  There were chains around us
                          Emaj7
  By Your grace we are no longer bound
  No longer bound
  F#sus
  You called me out of the grave
                G#m7    
  You called me into the light
  E2
  You called my name, and then my heart came alive!
  
  CHORUS
  ------      
  B
  Your love is greater! 
  E
  Your love is stronger!
  G#m                F#sus
  Your love awakens, awakens, 
  E2
  awakens me!

  VERSE 2
  -------      
  B
  Feel the darkness shaking 
  All the dead are coming
  Emaj7
  back to life, back to life
  B
  Hear the song awaken all creation singing 
  Emaj7
  we're alive, cause You're alive!
  F#sus
  You called me out of the grave
                G#m7
  You called me into the light
  E2
  You called my name, and then my heart came alive!

  Death can't hold us down!
