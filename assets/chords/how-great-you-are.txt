 G
 YOU CALL OUT THE STARS
 ---------------------- 
 VERSE 1
 -------
     G
 When I think the closest star
             Am
 is more than a million miles away
           C                    G
 I can't even dream, how great you are
     G
 When I think that all I have
 Am
 is what you've given me
     C                          G
 I'm so thankful Lord, so thankful Lord
 
 CHORUS
 ------
                 C        
 You called out the stars and they 
           G
 shine for You (x2)
  D/F#      Em           
 How great You are Lord, 
     D/F#      G
 how great You are! (x2)
 
 VERSE 2
 -------
     G
 When I think You walked on water,
  Am
 and calmed the raging seas
       C                      G
 I am overwhelmed, how great You are
 G
 Amidst the storms and troubles, 
 Lord you beckon me
         Am                  G
 To walk on water, I'll walk on water
 
 BRIDGE
 ------
               C              G
 To whom can I compare You, Holy one?
          C                    G
 Who is Your equal, Lord there is none!
       D/F#   Em            D/F#      G
 There is none beside You, how great You are
       D/F#    Em          D/F#      G
 There is none so worthy, how great You are
  D/F#      Em            D/F#      G
 How great You are Lord, how great You are!
