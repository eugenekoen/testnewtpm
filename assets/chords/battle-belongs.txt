  D                               
  When all I see is the battle, 
             G2
  you see my victory
  Bm7                                
  When all I see is the mountain,

  you see a mountain moved
  D                                      
  And as I walk through the shadows, 
                G2
  your love surrounds me
  Bm7                               
  There's nothing to fear now,

  with my hands lifted high

  Oh God, the battle belongs to you

  Every fear I lay at your feet, 
        Bm7              G
  I’ll sing through the night

             G2
  who can be against me
  Bm7                         Asus    G2
  For Jesus there’s nothing impossible for you
  D

  you see the beauty

  God you see the empty tomb
