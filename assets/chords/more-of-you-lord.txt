   A

   VERSE 1
   -------
   A                    Asus4    F#m
   When the broken are torn
                        E        Bm
   and the lame need to walk
                  D
   where can they find
                   E
   the answer they seek
    
   VERSE 2
   -------
   When the blind need to see
   and the world needs to feel
   where can they find
   a God that is real
    
   PRE-CHORUS
   ----------
        D        F#m      D
   Take me, send me, fill me
            Bm            E
   with the power of Your Love
    
   CHORUS
   ------
                 D
   Touch with my hands
                E
   walk with my feet
                 F#m
   Speak with my voice
                      E
   Lord use me as You please
