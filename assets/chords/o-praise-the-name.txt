  INTRO

  C    Em   F   C   Em    F
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
              C
  I cast my mind to Calvary
              G             Am
  Where Jesus bled and died for me
              F                      C
  I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
              G          C        Em  F
  My Saviour on that cursed tree
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
              C         Csus        C
  His body bound and drenched in tears
                  G              Am
  They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
                  F               C
  The entrance sealed by heavy stone
          G               C
  Messiah still and all alone
  
  
  CHORUS
  ------
      C                      F        C
  O praise the Name of the Lord our God
      Am                Gsus    G
  O praise His Name forever - more
      C/E                  F         Am
  For endless days we will sing Your praise
      F        G        C
  Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
  
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
                  C
  And then on the third at break of dawn
              G          Am
  The Son of heaven rose again
              F                C
  O trampled death, where is your sting
              G                 C     Csus
  The angels roar for Christ the King
   
  VERSE 4
  -------
              C
  He shall return in robes of white
              G                 Am
  The blazing sun shall pierce the night
              F              C
  And I will rise among the saints
              G                C
  My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
   
  ENDING

      F        G        C
  Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
      F        G        C
  Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
