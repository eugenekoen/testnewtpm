  I'VE FOUND A LOVE
  -----------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
      E                     Esus4
  When I call on Your name You answer
      E                        Esus4
  When I fall You are there by my side
      E                 Esus4
  You delivered me out of darkness
      E                   Esus4
  Now I stand in the hope of new life.

          E                    A2
  You're my God and my firm foundation
      E                          A2
  It is You whom I'll trust at all times
      E                     A2
  I give glory and praise, adoration
      E                       A2
  To my Saviour who's seated on high
