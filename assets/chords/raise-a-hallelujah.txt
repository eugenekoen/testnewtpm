  VERSE 1

  C                        F

  Am                 G
  I raise a Hallelujah louder than the unbelief
  C                     F

  I raise a Hallelujah, heaven comes to fight for me
  
  CHORUS

  I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm

  Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar
  F                   C

  Death is defeated, the King is alive

  C                      F
