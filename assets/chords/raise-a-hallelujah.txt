  C                        F
  I raise a Hallelujah in the presence of my enemies
  Am                 G
  I raise a Hallelujah louder than the unbelief
  C                     F

  I raise a Hallelujah, heaven comes to fight for me
  
  CHORUS

  F                     C
  I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm

  Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar
  F                   C

  Death is defeated, the King is alive
