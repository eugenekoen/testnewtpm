  AT THE CROSS

  VERSE 1
  -------
          Am           G     C                F
  There’s a place, where mercy reigns and never dies
          Am           G          C                    F
  There’s a place, where streams of grace flows deep and wide
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
        G           F
  All the love, I’ve ever found
             G                   F
  Comes like a flood, comes flowing down
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  F
  At the cross, at the cross
  C
  I surrender my life
       G                  Dm
  I’m in awe of you; I’m in awe of you
           F                     C
  Where your love ran red, and my sins washed white
      G                 Dm
  I owe all to you, I owe all to you
  F
  Jesus
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  There’s a place, where sin and shame are powerless
  Where my heart has peace with God, and forgiveness
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  F                      Am
  Here my hope is found, here on holy ground
  C                G
  Here I bow down, here I bow down
  F                    Am
  Here arms open wide, here you saved my life
  C                G
  Here I bow down, here I bow
