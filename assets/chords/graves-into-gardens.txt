  INTRO

  B   E/B   B

  FIRST VERSE
  -----------
    E/B       B
  I searched the world
      E/B         B
  But it couldn’t fill me
               G#m
  Man’s empty praise
                     F#
  and treasures that fade
             E
  Are never enough

  SECOND VERSE
  ------------
                 B
  Then You came along
    E/B               B
  And put me back together
             G#m               F#
  And every desire is now satisfied
             E
  Here in Your love

  CHORUS
  ------
              B
  Oh there’s nothing better than You
          G#m
  There’s nothing better than You
                E
  Lord there’s nothing, nothing is better
       B
  than You

  INTERLUDE
  ---------
  B   E/B

  THIRD VERSE
           B
  I’m not afraid
     E              B
  To show You my weakness
                  G#m
  My failures and flaws
                        F#
  Lord You’ve seen them all
                        E
  And You still call me friend

  FOURTH VERSE
                         B
  ‘Cause the God of the mountain
         C#m         B
  Is the God of the valley
                G#m
  There’s not a place
                 F#
  Your mercy and grace
                E
  Won’t find me again

    You turn mourning to dancing
                            E  B
  You give beauty for ashes

  You’re the only one who can (repeat line)

                             E  B
  You turn bones into armies
  You turn seas into highways
             G#m  E       B
  You’re the only one who can
             G#m  E       B
  You’re the only one who can
