  Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run
  F#m                E         D    A
  The fountain I drink from; oh He is my song
   A                      D            A
  Let the King of my heart be the shadow where I hide
  F#m            E           D   A
  The ransom for my life; oh, He is my song

  Let the King of my heart be the wind inside my sails
  F#m            E           D    A
  The anchor in the waves; oh He is my song
   A                      D            A
  Let the King of my heart be the fire inside my veins
   F#m         E       D       A
  And the echo of my days; oh He is my song
