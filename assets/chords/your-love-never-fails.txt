  Em   C   G   D
  Nothing can separate
  Even if I ran away
  Your love never fails
  
  I know I still make mistakes
  But You have new mercies for me everyday
  Your love never fails
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  C  G  D  Am
  You stay the same through the ages
  Your love never changes
  There maybe pain in the night
  But joy comes in the morning
  
  And when the oceans rage
  I don't have to be afraid
  Because I know that You love me
  Your love never fails
  
  C   Em   D

  VERSE 2
  -------
  Em   C   G   D
  The wind is strong and the water's deep
  But I'm not alone in these open seas
  Cause Your love never fails
  
  The chasm is far too wide
  I never thought I'd reach the other side
  But Your love never fails
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  C   Em   D  
  You make, all things, work together for my good.
