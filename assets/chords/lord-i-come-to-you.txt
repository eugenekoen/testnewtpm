  Flowing from the grace
              D7      G   D
  That I've found in You
  G                   Em
  Lord I've come to know
                    Bm    Em
  The weaknesses I see in me
                    C   D7

                        C
  And I will soar with You
                        D
  Your Spirit leads me on
