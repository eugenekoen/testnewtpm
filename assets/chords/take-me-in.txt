  Em
  TAKE ME IN
  ----------

  VERSE
  -----
  Em
  Take me past the outer courts
  C
  Into the Holy Place
  D
  Past the brazen altar
          Em              D
  Lord I want to see your face
  Em
  Pass me by the crowds of people
          C
  And the Priests who sing your praise
      D
  I hunger and thirst for your righteousness
  Am                          D
  But it's only found in one place
  
  CHORUS
  ------
          Em               D
  Take me into the holy of holies
          C                      Em    D
  Take me in by the blood of the lamb
          Em               D
  Take me into the holy of holies
              C              Bm           Em
  Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am
