  D      
  There's a wind a-blowin',
  G/D 
  all across the land
  D
  A fragrant breeze of Heaven
  G/D  
  Blowin' once again
  G
  Don't know where it comes from
  C/G    
  Don't know where it goes
                        G                
  But let it blow over me
  A   A  A/G        G     
  Oh,         sweet wind,
  D                G/D
  come and blow over me
  
  D      
  There's a rain a-pourin',
  G/D
  showers from above
  D
  Mercy drops are comin'
  G/D
  Mercy drops of love
  G
  Turn your face to heaven
  C/G
  Let the water pour
                        G
  Well let it pour over me
  A   A  A/G        G     
  Oh,          sweet rain,   
  D                G/D
  Come and pour over me
  
  
  There's a fire a-burnin',
  falling from the sky
  Awesome tongues of fire
  Consuming you and I
  Can you feel it burnin'
  Burn the sacrifice
  Well let it burn over me
  Oh, sweet fire,
  Come and burn over me
