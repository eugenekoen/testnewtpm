 VERSE 1

    Db                  Gb              Db
 A thousand generations falling down in worship
     Bbm             Ab(add4)    Gb2
 To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
     Db
 And all who’ve gone before us 
      Gb           Db
 and all who will believe
       Bbm             Ab(add4)    Gb2
 Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
 
 PRE-CHORUS 1
 ------------
      Gb2                Bbm
 Your name is the highest
 Your name is the greatest
 Your name stands above them all
 All thrones and dominions
 All powers and positions
 Your name stands above them all
 
 Half-Chorus
 And the angels cry, Holy
 All creation cries, Holy
 You are lifted high, Holy
 Holy forever
 
 Verse 2
 If you’ve been forgiven 
 and if you’ve been redeemed
 Sing the song forever to the Lamb
 If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
 Sing the song forever to the Lamb
 We’ll sing the song forever and amen
 
 Chorus
 Hear your people sing, Holy
 To the King of Kings, Holy
 You will always be, Holy
 Holy forever
 
 Tag
 You will always be, Holy
 Holy forever
