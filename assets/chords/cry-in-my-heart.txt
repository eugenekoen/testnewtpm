  CRY IN MY HEART
  ---------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  G
  There's a cry in my heart  
  D            Dsus2
  For your glory to fall   
  Am                              Dsus4   D
  For your presence to fill up my senses  

  G
  There's a yearning again
  D
  A thirst for discipline   
  Am                           Dsus4   D
  A hunger for things that are deeper

  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------  
  Em                   C
  Could you take me beyond   
  G                    D/F#
  Could you carry me through
  Em               C
  If I opened my heart 
  Dsus4                  D
  Could I go there with you

  Em                   C
  For I've been here before
  G                        D/F#
  Yet I know there's still more
  Am                Dsus4   D
  O Lord, I need to know you
      
  CHORUS
  ------
                  C
  For what do I have   
                          G
  If I don't have you Jesus     
                  D/F#
  What in this life   
                  Em
  Could mean anymore  
                  C
  You are my rock  
                  G
  You are my glory  
                  D/F#    C     Em
  You are the lifter of my head
      
  C   Em   C   D   G
