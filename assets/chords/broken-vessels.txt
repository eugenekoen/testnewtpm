  VERSE 1
  -------
              Bm
  All these pieces
              D
  Broken and scattered
              Bm
  In mercy gathered
              D
  Mended and whole
          Bm
  Empty handed
          D
  But not forsaken
                  A
  I've been set free
                  G             A
  I've been set free
  
  CHORUS 1
  --------
      G
  Amazing grace
      A
  How sweet the sound
          Bm                  G
  That saved a wretch like me
          G
  Ooh I once was lost
      A
  But now I'm found
      Bm              G
  Was blind but now I see
  
                      D     A
  Oh I can see You now
                      Bm           G
  Oh I can see the love in Your eyes 
                      D     A
  Laying Yourself down
                  Bm         G
  Raising up the broken to life
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
                  Bm
  You take our failure
                  D
  You take our weakness
                  Bm
  You set Your treasure
                  D
  In jars of clay
                  Bm
  So take this heart Lord
                  D
  I'll be your vessel
                  A
  The world to see
                  Bm   A
  Your life in me
