  DRAW ME CLOSE

  VERSE
  -----
  A                D
  Draw me close to you
  E            A
  Never let me go
  E            D
  I lay it all down again
  D                    F#m
  To hear you say that I'm your friend
  A             D
  You are my desire
  E                A
  No one else will do
  E                        D
  Cause nothing else could take your place
  D                     F#m
  To feel the warmth of your embrace
  A                D        E                 A    E
  Help me find the way,     bring me back to you
  
  CHORUS

  A      E     D
  You're all I want
  A      E        D    E
  You're all I've ever needed
  A      E     D
  You're all I want
  D            E       A                F#m
  Help me know you are near
