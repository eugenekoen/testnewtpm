   VERSE 1
   -------
   C               G               D
   Higher than the mountains that I face
   C                 G           D
   Stronger than the power of the grave
   C               G            D
   Constant in the trial and the change

   For it overwhelms and satisfies my soul

       C    G   D         C   G   D
   One thing remains One thing remains

      C         G         D
   In death, In life, I'm confident and
   Am             C        G          D
   covered by the power of Your great love
      C       G             D
   My debt is paid, there's nothing that can
   Am          C          G          D
   separate my heart from Your great love
